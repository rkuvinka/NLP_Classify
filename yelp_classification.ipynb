They only thing that is additional are the death certificates(which are a consistent price no matter where you go since they are from the county) and an urn that is of your choosing on how elaborate or as simple as you may like. They are family owned and don't have a large staff that requires the extra cost for the same things. You're not giving up any sort of quality through their lower price point, you're getting great service where they truly appreciate and value the customer and this difficult life event. They are compassionate, thorough and they don't try to take advantage of a delicate situation. They never once tried to up sell me on anything. Even when it came to the death certificates, I was told by someone that I needed to order 15 extra, and Sam actually told me that I won't need that many since most places don't keep the original! He didn't need to tell me that, but he did, and I really appreciated it. They were so easy to work with, and made me feel completely confident in how everything was being handled. They explain everything that you may not quite understand and take care of all of the paperwork. They truly helped make a tragic situation the best it could be. \n",

I live in Arcadia and have driven by the Bike Barn hundreds of times... but now it was my time to explore what they had in store for me.

I snuck out of work and went straight there.  There it was! My furious cruiser staring right at me!  The sales person came up to me and asked how he could help.  I immediately responded with I want this one..... Sadly I was informed that it was a children's bike.  Now you understand how little I know about bikes.  He kindly escorted me to the adult section were I discovered a baby blue cruiser that made my heart melt.  It was dressed in a giant red bow and had white flowers painted on it, a tan leather seat with more flowers and cork handle bars.  The best part was that it had a basket.  I bought it right then and there.  The sales guy ( I wish I could remember his name) was so kind.  He took my new purchase to the back were he examined her and made sure she was good to go.  Before I left he made sure to tell me to bring it back in 30 days and they will give her a tune up!  Since buying her she has been back for a tune up and checked out perfectly.

I asked if I could soak my feet and they initially said no, only said yes after I asked why... they didn't want my feet soaking for too long. hmmm.  Then they told me someone would be over in 3 minutes. 15 minutes later finally someone came over to me but by that time it was too late. I told her I had to be home in a half an hour and she said that the pedicures only should last 30 minutes anyway.  I ultimately did not get the pedicure. \n",

We were targeting either Bill Miller or Del Web middle school for our daughter, two of the best middle school in the Vegas area (ruled out Sig Middle School in Summerlin). During a house hunting trip, we visited numerous apartment and ultimately decided to go with Chateau. We like the apartment and the fact the school bus pick-up my kid for Del Web in front of the apartment. We had some initial hiccups as the summer intern was at times not very responsive to our inquiry. But this changed when we moved in and worked with Edith. She is wonderful and very pleasant, always reminded me to say hello to my wife. Desiree is also wonderful, she is a straight shooter and will help with addressing and prioritizing issues. Desiree is the front office manager. My wife and I love Edith and Desiree, wonderful people. We moved out in March of this year and we left the apartment spotless. They took off $50 from my deposit money which is fair and we received the remainder in the mail 3-4 weeks later. The only negative I would say is the garbage disposal, we had numerous issues with clogs but they eventually agreed replace the non-functional disposal.\n",

She then have us a formula sample and coupons! Overall we were impressed! We will be bringing our other children to this office as well.

Pool build and quality is %100. You get what you pay for in life. The landscape crew was fantastic and worked well together with us on any changes.they rate a 10+++. the travertine crew was a show in itself. They need their own TV show.

My golden puppy went in for neuter surgery as well as a repair to his belly for a previous issue and after I got him home I noticed the issues right away. His back legs were not as stable as before the surgery and his tail just hung in place and couldn't raise. When I returned with him for his check up I mentioned this and they said they didn't know what it was and charged me several hundred dollars to do X-rays and found nothing wrong. I then took him to a specialist that said he had a spinal cord stroke during his surgery and that is what is causing his sway and legs to not be stable. I then made an appt to speak with the Vet who preformed the surgery to get some resolution and future expenses covered for anything related to his legs and was told there was nothing they could do! I was told \"\"things happen\"\" under anesthesia! They took no responsibility for this which is very disappointing after going to this hospital for so many years. My other golden was misdiagnosed for a poisonous spider bite and I was just sent home being told it was a hot spot. When I brought her back after I realized more was wrong they said it was a good thing since it was so much worse! My advice is think twice before going here! I will not be returning!\"\n",

So that visit was so-so. Now 4 months later I made sure I scheduled with someone else. Oh boy!!!! The body wasn't horribly bad, but she messed my little gals face up. Clipper gouge lines on the sides of her snout. Her head was just cut horrible and choppy. Ears again had black gunk in them. She did do a good job plucking ear hairs. Now my Yorkies Xmas pictures are going to look terrible. They are very nice, but that doesn't mean they are good. Won't be back - they need to charge way less for inexperienced groomers.

There is always at least two or three people in the office at any given time, so there is never a shortage of people to help you, and I never feel like I am being rushed so that they can help the next person.

Each unit also has a dishwasher, an outdoor storage unit, and a covered parking spot, which is key in this hot Arizona weather.  The complex has a 24-hour gym, which is kind of small, but I never feel like it's crowded when I go, and I go almost daily.  There's probably only one or two other people in there at any given time, IF that.  The gym key is a one-time $50 fee, but when you return the key, you'll get $25 back, so it's really like you're paying a $25 deposit and $25 actual fee.  There are also 3 different pools here.  The front one near the office is heated and has a hot tub as well, but in the summer months, it doesn't really matter which pool you go in because they all feel nice.  I know that there is also a newly renovated recreation center, but I have yet to go in it.

There usually isn't a ton of noise, and there's a good mix of families, couples, single-working folks, and students (who aren't really the partying type since this complex is a little farther than others).

The volunteer coordinator, Marcus (the point of contact via email and also the coordinator at the location on our days of helping) is helpful and patient. On all occasions, I had teens aged 12-17 in our group. For some of them, it was their first time experiencing/making direct contact with those less fortunate. Marcus always assigns the teens/younger adults the jobs that have direct interaction, as he feels that is where they will benefit the most. It is a good strategy. I have served during both dinner time slots, and have also spent hours with my group, organizing the food donation pantry. The processes have always been efficient and organized. I am so glad there are such places like this that take care of those who need the help, and that allow us community members to be directly involved.

I get in his office and he's blasting his music. I love rap as much as the next person but after telling him about my father he continues to let his music play which is offensive (cussing) and loud. I told him I needed an estate account per my lawyer. He instead tries to talk me into having a check sent to me for the balance. I told him again I needed an estate account. During my time there he was cussing and making in appropriate comments. He said I wouldn't have access to the money until Monday (The date I was there was a Friday) because a person can't open and close an account the same day. This is not what I was told at another branch but I didn't argue. I asked to set an appointment for Monday. He instead insisted that I text his \"\"personal cell phone\"\". Monday comes and I text him around 430p AND call him (he didn't answer so I left a VM)as I was busy all day and he texts back at 4:57pm and tells me it's too late they close at 5pm. I'm pretty upset at this point. I tell him via text since he wouldn't return my call that I would have preferred to set an appt. He said \"\"that's why I was setting the expectation that I will work around you\"\". I ask if he can please set an appt for me for Tuesday and that I'd prefer to work with someone else. He ignores my request and continues to text me that this is my fault I wasn't able to come in. I tell him I want to speak with a manager and would like his managers name he texts back (Nope sorry can't do that). He finally calls me (it's going on 520-530 now) and finally sets an appt for the following day. My mom and I come in the next day (I didn't feel comfortable going alone), he is extremely rude. I was trying to use his pen and it fell apart when I took the cap off I said \"\"oh no your pen broke\"\" he replied \"\"or maybe you broke it\"\" in a ridiculously condescending tone. Then as I'm looking at some of the paperwork he snatches it away from me and walks out of the office without saying a word. When he comes back I ask him for the numbers that were on the paperwork. He let out a big sigh and said \"\"fine I'll have to pull up your account\"\" as if I was inconveniencing him. Then I ask to pull out some money and he says I'll have to wait in line for a teller. I told him that was fine. The amount I wanted was over 7k. A coworker overheard us talking and said I could only take out 7k but that they could order us the full amount and it would be there by the end of the week. I declined. I asked if 7k was the daily limit. She said yes unless I use a special ATM as that would allow 10k but I didn't have a debit card since the account was brand new. Fast forward a day, I decide to go to a different branch to pull out money. They tell me that there is no daily limit if you're at a branch and I was able to take out well over 7k. The customer service there is terrible.

      "\"Never EVER again. I used to go to their previous location and found such a bad ass stylist named Natalie. She highlighted my hair prettiest color of blonde and gave me a great cut. One day i'm sick of it, so I dye my hair medium brown from a box color for a change. I kept it for a few months and wanted to back to blonde, so I called to make an appointment. Apparently, Globe moved to their salon to LV Blvd off Charleston (basically in the ghetto in some hotel) and i'm like okay. Then I find out Natalie moved to San Francisco. Sad face. So I made an appointment with Megan, missed it because I had to work and they set me up with some other girl who was from New York. I went in having long brown hair and left with an orange bob, yes an ORANGE bob. I asked for a change, something different and some blonde again. So she puts bleach in my hair, says the brown wasn't pulling out, so then she puts MORE bleach in my hair (mind you I had brown dye in my hair, not black). I'm like okay this is taking a long time. So she starts drying my hair and i'm like why does my hair look one dimensional and orange? So I start crying in the chair. At the fact that I just cut off hair that was to my bra straps to a bob where I could feel my neck and orange. I go to the counter and they charge me for COLOR CORRECTION WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME PRIOR. I made the appointment for a cut, color, and highlight. I left with   a shitty orange bob that cost me $400. Embarrassed because I just paid my rent the week before and expected to pay $250, I didn't have enough in my bank account to cover that and gratuity and the fact that I was furious about having to pay for color correction without notification. Stacy, one of the owners, agreed to writing down my card number and charging me the rest the next week. I was embarrassed, so I just agreed. She said they couldn't do anything about the color but I could come back in in a few days and they could lighten it more and fix it. I did that, and you know what I got? An unflattering shade of blondish orange bob. At work the next day people were like.. Oh you look like a different person. The honest ones said, \"\"Well don't worry Jenna, it's just hair. I've seen worse\"\". Yes they saw worse to a haircut that cost me FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. Mind you, it's been about a year and a half since that happened, never will I ever go back there\n",

I don't think anyone really cares to come to a manicurist to hear about their problems it's supposed to be a day of pampering for you the client this place just all around sucks they make you wait half an hour in a chair at a table were there is no one and then they will come help you I've been to many places that have better customer service than this and this is definitely one place I will never come back to or recommend\n",

      "I was there for a college visit with my daughter, and we stayed in a one bedroom suite with a sofabed (which she reports was about average for a sofabed comfort-wise). The price was moderate for a nice hotel near the university, though higher than I usually pay for hotels. There was a small, very functional kitchen which we used mostly for morning coffee and heating leftovers, but could have worked for making basic meals. The shower had good water pressure and a nice adjustable showerhead. Free Wifi worked well except for one day, but the phone has a direct line to tech support which fixed my problem. When we booked, the room description said \"\"no view\"\" but our window had a great view of north Oakland, Bloomfield, East Liberty, Shadyside, bits of Lawrenceville and points further north and east. Maybe they meant no view of downtown or the rivers.\n",

Could get monotonous if you're there for a couple of weeks, but fine for a long weekend. Breakfast was fantastic-a great selection from sweet carbs to fruit to eggs, potatoes and sausage, refilled all during breakfast hours, served in a room by the front desk, with the opportunity to eat on the terrace when the weather is good. Free shuttles took me to and from the places that were a little too far to walk but much of Oakland was a 10-15 minute walk away. For a day trip out of town we rented a car- there is an Enterprise, an Avis and a Budget all within a short walk. I didn't use the parking garage, which costs $15 per night.

The bite quickly became infected. The infection ran all the way from the wound on his hand and continued to spread up his arm at an astonishingly fast rate. When he arrived at Banner Desert he was treated as though he was trash. The staff assumed he was a junkie with an infection from a needle. They were slow to treat him, kicked his girlfriend out of the hospital for becoming emotional and had security guards surround him when he became upset at the accusations. This experience showed my family and I that the quality of staff, along with their judgment calls, at Banner Desert is sub-par at best. Unless you are in immediate danger of death I would not suggest visiting this hospital it is worth an extra drive to receive proper treatment, on a personal (customer service) as well as a professional (medicinal) level.

I'd had a bad experience with Dr. Nelson with the delivery of my daughter in 2009 (Considering him to manage your pregnancy? Don't do it. He's dangerously incompetent.) Due to my not wanting to see Dr. Neslon, I decided to schedule with Dr. O'Sullivan. Big mistake. She is bitter, angry and *unbelievably* unprofessional. This woman is a poor representation of the medical community. She started off by noticing that I'm starting a topical progesterone supplement this month. And so she asked me who had prescribed it, and I told her it was my physician who manages my thyroid condition. She asked me right away if it was a \"\"Naturopath, or something like that?\"\" & I informed her that, it was an MD, Integrative Medicine who had prescribed it for me. She then goes on to ask me what am I trying to achieve. Umm...  I told her hormone balance. Duh! WTH do you think I'm trying to achieve? I explained that we had tested my levels and my progesterone level was low. She proceeded to ask me what my symptoms were. Basically, I felt like she was grilling me as to why I would be supplementing with progesterone. Aside from the fact that my freaking blood tests showed it was low? She then goes on to say \"\"Well, the only proven benefit to supplementing with progesterone is sleep. It's not going to help with weight loss, or anything like that. Generally speaking, if you're still getting your cycle then you are fine, and I would not recommend supplementing with progesterone. But hey, sleep is important too, so that's okay.\"\" I'm sorry, but #1 I never mentioned weight loss (I'm already at a healthy weight) and #2 I'm pretty sure that progesterone supplementation is proven to correct a low progesterone level. How about that benefit? So then she is asking about other things and I mentioned that I'm in the early stages of a separation/divorce. She then tells me how she thinks happy marriages rarely exist, and how she knows maybe 2 happy marriages out of all the married friends she has. Well, that's uplifting. Thanks, Doc. So a little later in the conversation she goes on to say how awful the dating scene is today, and that \"\"It's really disgusting out there. These women think they're okay since they've been married/only with one person for all these years, so they go and have sex with some guy whose slept with 300+ women while you've (she's) been married all those years. And they end up with herpes.\"\" And then she follows that lovely story by telling me \"\"The only people who are dumber than my teenagers are the 40-something divorced women.\"\" I'm pretty much in shock at this point. So she goes on to say \"\"... So just be sure and protect yourself and use a condom when you're out there sowing your wild oats\"\". I could not believe my ears.

      "\"I've lived in an apartment owned by Mullins for over a year now.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  The owner, Carol Mullins, is such a sweet lady.  She reminds me of my grandmother!  She is always very nice and understanding.  I had to pay my rent late once...I called her ahead of time to let her know and she was completely willing to work with me on the issue, no problem.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  They are responsive to repairs.  Our A/C unit in our apartment was EXTREMELY outdated when we moved in....I didn't even want to use it because I was afraid of how much electricity it would use (plus, it didn't work very well anyway)... One day this summer it was unbearably hot, so we turned it on.  It worked for about half an hour, then died.  I called Carol right away and she sent someone over the next day and we got a brand new (and energy efficient) A/C unit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.  The rest of the unit has fairly new appliances. \n",

      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  PARKING.  When I was first shown the apartment I am now living in, I was told one parking spot was included with the apartment (yayy!!)  When I brought in my application for the apartment I was told once again, by Carol herself, that there was one parking spot included with the apartment (and she even wrote it down in the amenities of the application page after I mentioned it to her...because it was not already on there...I also have 2 other witnesses who were with me on both occasions).  She approved me right away after overlooking my application and we signed the lease.  Now, I don't even get a parking spot half the time.  Why?   There are only five spots in the lot.  There is supposed to be one for each 2-bedroom apartment in the apartment complex.  However, anybody who wants to park back there does.  We weren't given parking permits.  Mullins decided they didn't want to spend the money on parking enforcement.  So, if both people in a 2-bedroom apartment have cars, and they both park back there...someone in the building is out a parking spot!  If someone decides to have friends over, their friends park back there, too.  So the parking situation is shitty, to say the least.  I've called and complained, but they won't do anything about it because they refuse to pay for enforcement.  Infuriating.  When living downtown, it's hard to find street parking - which is why I wanted this apartment with \"\"one parking spot included.\"\"  PFFT!  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  My apartment was filthy when I first moved in.  I had A LOT of cleaning to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  There were a few minor problems in my apartment when I first moved in, that were never fixed.  For example, the weatherstrip in the window sill of my living room is all torn out and curled up.  I wrote this on the repairs form when I first moved in, but it never got fixed.  However, I never called about it to remind them or anything because it didn't bother me enough to have to deal with it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.  We didn't decide to renew our lease right away, so Mullins wanted to start showing our apartment right away... back in February.  Our lease isn't up until August...... what!??\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Our rent went up when we renewed our lease.  Granted, it didn't go up much, but still.  Have improvements been made to our apartment to validate the price going up??? No.\"\n",

I did only pay 15 dollars and I'm not sure if that's the regular price or why they charged so cheap (maybe because they knew they would be rushing and didn't want me to have to pay full price for their work.

Our 13-month-old son went for his first check-up and was tortured by the hygienist and dentist. He is a very calm boy who has no problem brushing his teeth or allowing mom or dad to help him brush. Yet they had him in near hysterics for the entire appointment! They were completely disorganized and unprepared for the appointment - had to run around to get additional items while our son was screaming. The only information provided was that he had 4 teeth starting to push through. Not a word was offered about the health of his teeth and gums, nor were any questions asked about his oral hygiene practices. We had to ask about everything to get any sort of information.\n",

Fortunately, my wife verified it was, in fact, fluoride and stopped them in time. To add insult to injury, they tried to charge us $130 after the appointment. We told them we would pay the $45 we were quoted for the exam and the billing employee responded \"\"it says here in the notes you were quoted $110.\"\" That's right! For exam and fluoride, the latter of which was declined. So why did they just try to charge us $130 if those notes were in the computer?

I had just purchased a black Givenchy dress shirt, one of the coolest details on the shirt were the two chrome numbers attached to the collar; a \"\"1\"\" and a \"\"7.\"\" I only had the chance to wear it once and dropped it off with the rest of my dry cleaning. Unfortunately when I picked the shirt up the metal numbers were bent and scratched. Had I not just bought the shirt and paid $600 for it, it wouldn't have been an issue. I immediately drove back to the cleaners to show the damage and find a resolution. I was informed that the manager Sarah was not in, but that she would call me. Later that same day I received a call from a clearly irritated Sarah who made it seem like I was a nuisance. She then told me to return the shirt to her and email her a picture of the receipt verifying the value, which I did that same night. I didn't hear back from her, and after two weeks I called back and she claimed to have not received the receipt so she gave me her email address again, it was the same one I had sent it to initially. So I re forwarded her the email. One week later after not hearing from her I called again. She told me to come pick up the shirt and she would give me a store credit as a consolation. When I went to pick up the shirt it wasn't there. So I dropped off my dry cleaning and left a note for her to call me. 4 days had passed and I went to get my dry cleaning and the shirt wasn't there. So I left another note for Sarah. She called me that same afternoon, and angrily told me I wouldn't get the shirt back because she gave me the credit. I told her that was not acceptable and if she wasn't returning the shirt that I needed cash not a credit to go purchase another one. She then threatened me with her lawyer.

      "2) Maintance issues were always fixed promptly \n",
      "3) It's affordable \n",

      "1) As another reviewer said it's incredibly loud! The windows, doors and walls are very thin. Neighbors play music and have parties at all hours and the pools are very loud too. \n",
      "2) There seems to be a some of crime. In all fairness it may have less than other complexes in the area.\n",
      "3) There was trash throughout the complex. It wasn't uncommon to find beer bottles and cans on my steps in the morning.\n",
      "4) The covered parking may not be near your apartment. Mine was practically on the other side of the complex. \n",
      "5) There always seemed to be just random people in the complex. For example, people from complex next door would come over and use our pool because their complex didn't have one. Or one time I was stopped by a homeless man as I was entering my apartment and asked if I had any spare change. For gated community it is easy for other people to get in.\n",

She did a great job shaping my toenails, my biggest pet peeve is when they cut them too short (I have small toenails so I like a little length left) and she left them the perfect length.

After some research of other facilities closer to where I live, I was able to schedule with SSE on the same day later in the afternoon. It was so worth the trip. Dr. Hales and the rest of the staff did a thorough evaluation, answered my many questions and concerns, and then took care of my very painful dental issue. I've been to endodontists and oral surgeons in the past, but I will travel to see Dr. Hales again because not only is he great at what he does and professional, but he is easy going, has a good sense of humor and is very conscientious.

      "\"In 2010 I was recommended Dr. David Moyer by my father's psychologist Dr. Andrew Erlich after a bad experience with another dentist. I saw Dr. Moyer from 2010-2014. He immediately had ex ray's taken of my teeth by an assistant who didn't use a led protection vest and didn't seem to know what she was doing. I was told I needed 4 crowns, 3 fillings, 2 root canals (the root canals were done by another dentist) and a night guard all for a price of $20,000.00. The night guard alone was $1,700.00. I questioned this but my father was paying the bill and I was told by him not to get involved. Soon my father had all his friends and family going to Dr. David Moyer. Dr. Moyer would not explain anything too me and treated me as though I did not have a right to know what he was doing to my mouth. Once while I was having some work done I was given laughing gas by Dr. Moyer and his assistant Abel. I was told the gas was turned up to the maximum. They both seemed to think this was funny. I left with a splitting headache and felt sick to my stomach. Dr. Moyer was physically rough with me when he examined my teeth on many occasions. In 2013 all his fillings fell out and I went back to have him fix them. He told me I needed another 4 crowns, the 3 fillings replaced for an additional full price (which were 3 huge holes in my teeth by now) and a replacement night guard this time for a total cost of $9,000.00. If cash was paid Dr. David Moyer would deduct $1,000.00 of the bill. He would still not explain to me or show me as to why I needed 4 more crowns? My father prepaid him the cash and I felt like I was being bullied by Dr. Moyer to have the work done. He called me and told me to show up the next day at 11am and he would explain everything then do the work immediately afterwards. I did not show up and he ended up having to return the money to my father. I had another opinion afterwards and the other dentist did not know what I was talking about when I asked \"\"If I needed an additional 4 crowns?\"\" after viewing Dr. Moyer's own ex rays of my mouth.

We made our layout and got our card stock from Kelly's paper and brought it in. The test run worked but when we tried to print a large amount the ink started smudging after the third one. The staff was nice enough to help us and told us we were using the wrong settings, so they fixed it and reimbursed us for the messed up ones. Then the images started to shift during printing so when they used the cutter to cut the invites, it did not come out as planned. They reimbursed us for the cutting and paid for the reprinting of those that got messed up. That was definitely more than I expected them to do. They suggested this professional folding machine that you had to crank manually for every fold you wanted. Each invite had 3 folds and we sent out over 120 invites, so my arms were dead by the end. Plus we decided to cut each by hand since the cutting machine was not compensating for the shift in printing. The two main staff members that helped us out were Levi and Tricia, who kept checking on us our whole 5 hours of work. They were extremely helpful and I'm sure they were surprised when I didn't freak out when things were going wrong. But I'm not a cry baby and they turned out AMAZING!

There were two guinea pigs packed in that thing, when it was way, way too small for one baby guinea pig. It also didn't look that clean - all the cages, in my opinion, were grungy. The whole place felt grungy and grimy. And they obviously weren't cleaning the cages everyday, which they should be doing. It would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each day.\n",

From the first phone call, I could tell this was the vet for us. They were courteous and knowledgable. Every visit, we received excellent care. Dr. Miller took his time with us like we were the most important customer. Our dog had multiple oral surgeries over the years and had many growths inspected for possible disease. Each time, Dr. Miller gave us advice as to what he would do in the given situation. It was nice to see him care for our animals as his own. The vet is also very cost effective. He does not charge you to excess. When it came time to put our dog to sleep in December, Dr. Miller stayed open late allowing our who family to say goodbye to our dog of 15 years. He showed great compassion for our loss. He truly is a class act. When I graduated college and went out on my own, I adopted a cat. Trying to stay within Humane Society guidelines, I took my cat to a Humane Society partner vet. That was a mistake. My kitten was never tested for worms and had Feline Herpes. I took my kitten to that vet for three visits over the span of 1.5 months. After the last visit, I quickly called Dr. Millers' office. I set up an appointment. With one appointment, Dr. Miller diagnosed every problem my kitten faced. He prescribed medicine for the worms and gave me a treatment plan for the Feline Herpes. I have not been back for a sick visit since that time. I do not regret giving up my free neuter through the Humane Society to have a healthy kitten. I knew when I adopted my kitten that I wanted him to be treated at Miller Animal Hospital. I should have trusted my instincts and gone there to begin with.\n",

They even had to take some extra steps because of my son's gag reflex and they did not make a big deal about it. Braces are never fun but APDO made this experience a really good one. And we even received a call later on that day to check to see how my son was doing! One more thing...Lisa has been super helpful the whole way through. We had some changes in insurance and she said not to worry because she would help us out and make it work and she really did! She has been great since the beginning. We looked at quite a few offices before making the switch and we are so happy we chose APDO!!!!\n",

I may be traveling to Phoenix from now on for hair appointments just to see Shelby. Without a doubt the best experience I've had with a stylist. I highly recommend her! She does an amazing color job!\n",

      "\"THINK AGAIN BEFORE PICKING MAYFLOWER AND SIERRA MOVING SYSTEMS!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have moved across the country, vertically and horizontally, multiple times in my Naval career and civilian career. Over half of these moves were performed by a competitor of Mayflower Moving. These moving experiences were relatively positive. For my most recent move, I chose Mayflower. What a gargantuan mistake. First of all, they were unable to provide an actual truck. Instead, showed up with three wooden crates strapped to the back of a flatbed. I was immediately apprehensive, but was assured that all of my items would fit just fine. Incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appraiser (Tyler) did not allocate enough boxes for the movers to pack our kitchen, which was the only 'room' of my house that I wanted fully packed professionally by Mayflower. We set up our kitchen so all of our relatively expensive appliances could be easily boxed and protected. The movers loaded up the truck with each individual appliance in only its original box, no extra padding, or even what I had wanted, the appliances to be packed together in a large box. They even tried to put our bread/pizza cutting board LOOSE on the truck. Extremely unsanitary and just dumb honestly. They loaded Tupperware that we had left out for them to pack as we were paying for a full kitchen pack, loose on the truck as well. My wife brought up to them why they weren't packing our kitchen. The main mover was rude and nasty to my wife and said that it was not his problem, he only brought the boxes he had been told to bring by our \"\"Move Coordinator\"\" who hadn't reached out to us once since he came and incorrectly estimated the number of boxes we would need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movers provided by Mayflower made us feel extremely uncomfortable with them handling our items and boxes. They barely said a word to us, and acted extremely burdened to be there. We noticed them moving our items in a completely unprofessional manner, sliding unprotected furniture items to get them onto the truck, stacking boxes in an inefficient and unsafe manner, etc. After the job was finished, the main mover told me to sign his tablet, and that I could review his inventory list when it was delivered to my email (which took a few days!). After I reviewed the list, I realized that the mover labeled everything from our vacuum cleaner to our brand new desk as \"\"sides faded, chipped, broken\"\", etc. The list makes absolutely zero sense and is highly inaccurate, which I can guarantee just based on the fact that he also labeled everything as being located in a bathroom. The movers seemed to be in a rush to leave, even though they hadn't even been working for long. They left all of their packing trash all over my house, my front yard, and in the street. We had to completely clean up after them. They left kitchen items that they didn't pack, that we either had to dispose of or pack into our personal vehicle that we were driving across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We set up this move so it would be as simple for the movers as possible. On top of all this, the delivery of my items was not within the Mayflower \"\"guaranteed delivery window\"\". My items arrived crushed in their boxes; even plastic bins were crushed and items were falling out. Multiple furniture items were severely damaged, including a clock that belonged to my wife's great grandfather. They managed to lose a huge piece of our 3 section couch because they didn't have room for it in the wooden crates they brought so they just placed in on the back of their flatbed truck. This was the worst move I have ever experienced. There is a large problem with communication between Mayflower employees/vendors. The employees never communicated anything to us, nor did they seem to care. We had to contact them for absolutely everything, and even contacting them was difficult. Our belongings have been tarnished by Mayflower and their associated vendors. When I reached out for a refund on my less-than-stellar kitchen pack I was assured that I would be receiving my refund quickly and correctly, by Nick. Over a month later and I'm still sitting here waiting to hear something. I have reached out multiple times and always receive the same information \"\"it's on it's way!\"\" When I contacted the sales manager about verifying the address my email was ignored. I contacted Mayflower directly who then told me that my check was for the incorrect amount and that it had been sent to the wrong address. I gave the contact my correct address, asking her to repeat it back, and she had again taken it down incorrectly. I'm appalled by the lack of professionalism shown by both Sierra Movers and Mayflower as a whole. I have still yet to hear anything about my broken and missing items that I filed a claim for to the tune of over $5,000, or about the reimbursement for my kitchen that wasn't packed.\"\n",
